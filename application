Dear Prof. Müntener,

I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a PhD position under your guidance. I am currently a third-year master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and expect to graduate in June 2023. After a comprehensive review of your published work, I am genuinely excited about your research and would like to inquire about the availability of PhD positions in the field of geochemistry for the upcoming year.

My current research focuses on Li isotopic systematics and numerical simulations related to the evolution of granitic magma and the exsolution of magmatic volatile phases (MVP). Your experiential studies on igneous crystallization have been very enlightening to my work. I have authored two SCI papers based on this research, with one already accepted by Ore Geology Reviews (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2023.105722), and the other currently undergoing moderate-to-major revisions in the Journal of Earth Science. Furthermore, I possess proficient skills in Python and R programming and have developed an open-source geochemical thermodynamic reaction platform named GeoTVP using R. For more information, please visit my personal homepage: http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~yxying.

Having immersed myself in your research domain, I am eager to pursue my doctoral studies under your mentorship.I believe I can actively contribute to research projects related to non-traditional stable isotope analysis, as well as geochemistry and thermodynamic computations. If there are no available PhD positions under your supervision for the upcoming year, I kindly request your assistance in recommending other potential advisors.

I eagerly await your response and the opportunity to become a part of your research team.

Sincerely,

Xiangying Ye

Dear Professor Cin-Ty A. Lee,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Xiangying Ye, and I am currently a third-year master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with an expected graduation date in June 2023. I am writing to express my genuine excitement and interest in your research and to inquire about the availability of PhD positions in the field of geochemistry for the upcoming year.

I first encountered your name during my undergraduate studies, although I regrettably cannot recall the specific occasion. It is possible that I came across your name in the context of some research papers I was reading while working on a course paper in petrology. Subsequently, I learned that you are a distinguished researcher specializing in topics related to "magma" and "mantle." When I was a junior student, while completing my foundational geology courses, my undergraduate advisor, Professor Li Bin, introduced me to papers authored by Dr. Tang Ming. It was during this time that I became aware of your significant contributions to the field as a Chinese professor at Rice University.

As I progressed in my academic journey, I encountered more of your work, including papers such as "Episodes of fast crystal growth in pegmatites" and "Extreme lithium isotope fractionation in quartz from the Stewart pegmatite." Your research deeply inspired me, and I developed a profound admiration for your academic achievements.

My current research primarily revolves around Li isotopic systematics and numerical simulations related to the evolution of granitic magma and the exsolution of magmatic volatile phases (MVP). I have a strong affinity for granite pegmatites due to their exceptional characteristics, which include large crystals and the presence of exquisite gemstone materials. My fascination with this topic began during my undergraduate studies, where I first experienced the marvels of nature, igniting my passion for geology. As of now, I have authored two SCI papers based on this research, with one already accepted by Ore Geology Reviews (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2023.105722), and the other currently undergoing moderate-to-major revisions in the Journal of Earth Science (See Attachment). However, I am fully aware that your expertise in magma evolution and your guidance can provide me with invaluable insights to advance my research. Additionally, I have developed some proficiency in Python and R programming and have developed an open-source geochemical thermodynamic reaction platform named GeoTVP using R. I believe I can make meaningful contributions to the study of granite evolution using non-traditional stable isotope analysis, geochemical and thermodynamic calculations, and other tools.

Apart from your academic accomplishments, I greatly admire your diligent work ethic and diverse interests. A senior doctoral students have shared me that the review comments you provided contained a wealth of valuable information. During the review process, You not only help the authors identify problems, but also suggest key points for improvement. Furthermore, I have visited your homepage many times and found your research and sketches on birds to be a testament to your deep love for nature. In summary, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of pursuing a doctoral degree under your guidance. I believe that, under your mentorship, I can further deepen my understanding of granite pegmatites and develop a more positive outlook on life.

I eagerly await your response and the opportunity to become a member of your esteemed research team.


Sincerely,

Xiangying Ye

Dear Professor Tamsin Mather,


I hope this message finds you well. I am currently a third-year master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and expect to graduate in June 2023. I am writing to inquire about Ph.D. positions in volcanology for the upcoming academic year. The China Scholarship Council is willing to sponsor my international studies.

I learned about your research from your paper, "The importance of volcanic emissions for the global atmospheric mercury cycle." Given the increasing issues of environmental pollution and climate change, utilizing various isotopes to understand the impact of volcanic processes on global geochemical cycles is a significantly interesting research topic. Therefore, I am keen to further explore this area during my Ph.D. studies, and I am particularly interested in the opportunity to work with you as my supervisor.

My current research area is "Li Isotope fractionation during the Late Devonian Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) event," in which I proposed that F-F extinction event may be related to volcanic activity during the same period. A positive Li isotope ratio excursion implies decreases weathering and likely climate cooling during this period. In addition, I am also interested in late-stage granite magmatic evolution and have authored two SCI papers on this field.

I have coded several programs in Python and R, totaling more than 10,000 lines, to develop GeoTVP, an open-source geochemical thermodynamic visualization web platform. Besides, I have worked in a clean room and MC-ICP-MS for three years and I can perform precise lithium isotope analysis on many natural samples, such as shale, mudstone, carbonate rock, igneous rock, etc. I believe my skills and experiences may align with your research interests and contribute to your team.

I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I genuinely appreciate any time you can spare to respond. Thanks very much.

Dear Prof. Dr. Philip Pogge von Strandmann,


I hope this message finds you well. I am currently a third-year master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and expect to graduate in June 2023. I am writing to inquire about Ph.D. positions in volcanology for the upcoming academic year. 

I learned about your research from your paper, "Lithium isotope evidence for enhanced weathering during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2." Given the increasing issues of environment change, utilizing lithium isotopes to understand the global carbon cycle is a significantly interesting research topic. Your research on Li isotopes in marine sediments has given me a lot of inspiration. Therefore, I am keen to further explore this area during my Ph.D. studies, and I am particularly interested in the opportunity to work with you as my supervisor.

My current research area is "Li Isotope fractionation during the Late Devonian Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) event," in which I proposed that F-F extinction event may be related to volcanic activity during the same period. A positive Li isotope ratio excursion implies decreases weathering and likely climate cooling during this period. In addition, I am also interested in late-stage granite magmatic evolution and have authored two SCI papers on this field.

I have coded several programs in Python and R, totaling more than 10,000 lines, to develop GeoTVP, an open-source geochemical thermodynamic visualization web platform. Besides, I have worked in a clean room and MC-ICP-MS for three years and I can perform precise lithium isotope analysis on many natural samples, such as shale, mudstone, carbonate rock, igneous rock, etc. I believe my skills and experiences may align with your research interests and contribute to your team.

Dear Professor Weiran Li,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your invaluable guidance during our interview yesterday. Your insights on my report have been extremely beneficial.

I am very sorry for not providing you with a clear answer about my choice during the interview. One reason is that I was too nervous when answering the question, and the other is that I am not sure if you can offer me an Phd position, so I contacted others before. After careful consideration, I would absolutely choose your research group if a doctoral opportunity with a scholarship is available. I assure you of my sincere commitment. The reasons are clear: (1) I have been following your research for a long time, and our interests align. (2) I am very curious about evolution of magma , especially the processes related to magmtic volatile, and you have many creative stuies in this field. (3) I am eager to contribute to programming projects and learn analytical instrument skills in your group. I believe that computer programs can help geologists work out complex geological processes. However, programming skills are not commonly found among geologists. I am confident in my ability to to learn any skills related to your research under your guidance.

Regarding the research statement we discussed yesterday, I have attached my brief personal statement below for your review. I would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have. With your guidance, I plan to refine it into a Word version.

In addition, I am currently filling out the HFPFS application form and I will send you the application number later today.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I hope to contribute to your research. 

Warm wishes,

Dear Prof. Richard M. Palin,

 

I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a PhD position under your guidance. I am currently a third-year master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and expect to graduate in June 2023. After a comprehensive review of your published work, I am genuinely excited about your research and would like to inquire about the availability of PhD positions in the field of geochemistry for the upcoming year.

 

My current research focuses on Li isotopic systematics and numerical simulations related to the origin of Li-rich pegmatite and the exsolution of magmatic volatile phases (MVP). Your recent studies on "petrogenetic model for anatectic origin lithium pegmatites" have been very enlightening to me. I have authored two SCI papers about "Li-Nb-Ta mineralization in granite-pegmatite systems", with one already accepted by Ore Geology Reviews (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2023.105722), and the other currently undergoing moderate-to-major revisions in the Journal of Earth Science. Furthermore, I possess proficient skills in Python and R programming and have developed an open-source geochemical thermodynamic reaction platform named GeoTVP using R. If you are interested, you can find more information on my personal homepage: http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~yxying.

 

Having immersed myself in your research domain, I am eager to pursue my doctoral studies under your mentorship.I believe I can actively contribute to research projects related to non-traditional stable isotope analysis, as well as geochemistry and thermodynamic computations. If there are no available PhD positions under your supervision for the upcoming year, I kindly request your assistance in recommending other potential advisors.


I eagerly await your response and the opportunity to become a part of your research team.

 

Sincerely,

 

Xiangying Ye

Dear Professor Weiran Li,

I want to express my gratitude for your detailed advice on my research plan. I will carefully revise the application materials based on your comments. Once the draft is ready, I will send it to you for your valuable comments.

Regarding the confusion in the application form:

1. I appreciate your clarification on the joint Ph.D. program. I have no intention of applying for a joint program, and I will promptly rectify my application.

2. Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy in my English test score. I want to clarify that I entered an expected English test score because the application system allows for document uploads after the initial submission, especially when supporting documents are not immediately available. I wanted to ensure I would not miss the application deadline, understanding that the effectiveness of supplementary materials is at the discretion of the admission committee. As mentioned in my previous email, I have scheduled the IELTS exam for November 25th, with results expected on 28th. Besides, I can take the exam once a week according to the IELTS rules. While it may be challenging for me to achieve the required English grades before the deadline (December 1st), I am confident that I can attain them by the end of December.

Moreover, I would like to know if I can still apply for the doctoral position under your guidance if I attain the required English grades after the deadline. If not, I think I should focus on preparing for the IELTS exam this week, specifically in English speaking.

On a personal note, I want to apologize for not responding yesterday. Due to recent weather changes, I caught a bad cold yesterday. I appreciate your understanding. Please take good care of yourself as well.

Thank you once again for your invaluable suggestions on my application materials. Looking forward to your reply.

Dear professor Richard Plain,

I am glad to tell you that I have recieved a offer from Oxford, and I am genuinely grateful to your surppot and time during the application process. 

I recently co-published a work on Chemical Geology for reconstructing lithium isotopic composition of Precambrian seawater. I did some contributions regarding sampling, caculation and simulation this work. and I already used those patterns in another topic of my master's project. Once I finish it, I will send it to you for review.

One more to mention, I also did a IELTS test today. I believe all the parts is well except writing, since there was a wrong with my keyboard. I have argued with the examiner and Reported this issue to the Official IELTS and it could be a long time for them to give me feedback. But I guess I can hit the english requirement of summer Pre-sessional Course even such unforeseeable issue happened. Surely I can use Pre-sessional Course to meet the language condition, but I want to know if I can sign up this course to eliminate language condition now, since almost all the student can pass the course. Otherwise, it could be troublesome for applying scholarships and I have to spend more time prepare for the test again.

Thanks again for your time and encouragement.

Best wishes
Xiangying


Dear Professor Richard Plain,

I am thrilled to share with you the news that I have been offered a place at Oxford, and I want to express my sincere gratitude for your unwavering support and guidance during the entire application process.

Recently, I co-authored a paper on Chemical Geology, which delves into the reconstruction of the lithium isotopic composition of Precambrian seawater (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2024.122040). In this work, I made significant contributions in sampling, calculations, and simulations. Moreover, I have successfully applied these methodologies to another aspect of my master's project. As soon as this project reaches completion, I plan to share it with you for your insightful review.

Furthermore, I sat for the IELTS exam yesterday. While I believe I performed well across all sections, I encountered a technical issue with my keyboard during the Writing portion. Despite my efforts to rectify the situation with the examiner and reporting the issue to Official IELTS, I anticipate it may take some time to receive feedback. Nevertheless, I remain confident that I have met the English language requirements for the upcoming summer Pre-sessional Course, despite this unforeseen setback.

I am considering enrolling in the Pre-sessional Course to fulfill the language requirement now, which would also serve as an excellent opportunity to acclimate to the English-speaking environment. However, I am seeking clarification on whether enrolling in this course now can eliminate the language condition. Otherwise, it could be troublesome for applying scholarships and I have to spend more time prepare for the test again those days.

Once again, I am immensely grateful for your time and encouragement throughout this journey.

Dear Professor Richard Plain,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on my application status.

Firstly, I am pleased to share that I have been recognized as an outstanding graduate student in Anhui Province, and I am also the only master's student in our college to receive this award. You can find more information about it here (http://ess.ustc.edu.cn/2024/0316/c31926a632656/page.htm).

However, I feel frustrated because despite my efforts and progress over the past three months, I have not achieved good results in IELTS exams. while the deadline to meet the condition of the offer is August 31st, the CSC wants me to fulfill  the requirement sooner. I will sit the IELTS exam again on March 27th in hopes of achieving the necessary scores. If not, I may need your help in providing a language proficiency certificate. I will replace it once I meet the requirement.

I apologize for troubling you with this matter. I am under significant stress due to my heavy workload- finishing my Master's thesis, revising papers, publishing a popular science book, and applying for scholarships. I couldn't sleep last night thinking about solutions. Do you think I should take on fewer projects?

In a nutshell, thank you for your ongoing support. It means a lot to me.

Best regards,

Xiangying



Dear Professor Richard Plain,

I'm glad to receive your reply! Thank you for your encouraging and inspiring words; they truly mean a lot to me. 

I am thrilled to learn that I have been offered a place at Oxford funded by the Clarendon Scholarship. Please accept my sincere gratitude for your unwavering support and guidance throughout this process. Without your recommendation, securing this scholarship would have been an uphill task. This news has energized me greatly, and I am confident that I can complete the remaining tasks with patience and a positive attitude.

Regarding the pre-sessional course, I have consulted the university website (https://www.lang.ox.ac.uk/summer-presessional-english-course#collapse4201911), and I am delighted to confirm that the course allows for the language condition to be waived. I will gather further information about it from Miss Bing Yu. I am also pleased to hear that my English proficiency during our conversations has made a positive impression, and I am committed to continuing to improve my English skills every day.

Moreover, your analogy of academic pursuits being a marathon rather than a sprint is truly insightful. Thank you for your wise words and encouragement. It appears that things are falling into place, and I will try to achieve a better work-life balance. I am eagerly anticipating the academic and personal experiences at Oxford and look forward to receiving further guidance from you.

In summary, your understanding and encouragement are invaluable to me. I will cherish them and apply them in my journey ahead.

Warm Regards,

Xiangying

Learning that I have been offered a place at Oxford funded by the Clarendon Scholarship is truly unbelievable. Does this wonderful news imply that I am no longer required to prepare the intricate materials for the CSC application?

Dear Professor Richard Plain,

Thanks for your reply and sorry for replying late myself. I have been preparing for my master's pre defense in the past week, which recieved credit from committee. 

I am grateful for the detailed imformation about the Clarendon Scholarship and constant support of you. I have receive an offer letter from University College today. I guess the formal letter Clarendon Scholarship will be sent to me in the following days. I will relay the message to you once I recive it from Oxford. 

Regarding the CSC application, I asked the teachers of the international office. They suggested that the likelihood of the CSC Scholarship being given to students who have already received full scholarships is very low. Therefore, there is no need for me to spend time dealing with those complex materials.

Moreover, I received official results the result of the last IELTS test did meet the minimum requirement of pre-sessional course and I got a free opportunity to take the IELTS exam due to the technical issue. I plan to enroll in the pre-sessional course first to ensure that I can successfully meet the language requirements. Meanwhile, I will continue practicing English in my spare time to prepare for the next IELTS exam.


Warm Regards,

Xiangying
